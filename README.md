![Alt text](https://github.com/Deirdre24/Plant.Co-Dynamic-Performance-Dashboard-Sales-GP-Quantity-2023-2024/blob/main/Report%20Screenshot.png)

## Overview

This Power BI dashboard provides an interactive analysis of Plant.Coâ€™s performance metrics, including Sales, Gross Profit (GP), and Quantity for the years 2023 and 2024. The data is dynamic, allowing users to:
- âœ… Select different metrics (Sales, GP, or Quantity)
- âœ… Drill up or down by country, month, and product category
- âœ… Compare Year-to-Date (YTD) vs Prior Year-to-Date (PYTD)
- âœ… Analyze sales trends, profitability, and regional performance

## Key Features & Metrics

### 1. Year Selection (2023 or 2024)
- Users can toggle between different years for analysis.
  
### 2. Dynamic Metric Selection (Sales, GP, or Quantity)
- The dashboard updates dynamically based on the selected measure.
  
### 3. Sales & Profitability Analysis
- S_YTD (Switch Year-to-Date): Total sales or data for the selected year.
- S_PYTD (Switch Prior Year-to-Date): Data up to the same point in the previous year.
- YTD vs PYTD Change: Difference in performance, indicating growth or decline.
- GP% (Gross Profit Percentage): Profitability indicator showing margin efficiency.
- Bottom 10 Underperforming Countries

### 4.  Identifies the lowest-performing markets to assess growth opportunities.
- Monthly Sales Trend (YTD vs PYTD by Product & Country)

### 5.  Tracks revenue fluctuations and seasonal performance.
- Account Probability Segmentation (GP% vs Sales)

### 6. Visualizes how sales volume correlates with profit margins.

## Data Exploration & Drill-Down Questions

- ðŸ”Ž Performance Analysis
How do current YTD sales compare to last yearâ€™s PYTD sales?
Which months contribute most to revenue growth or decline?
What factors led to sales dips in specific months (e.g., February, September, December)?

- ðŸ”Ž Market & Regional Analysis
Which countries have the lowest YTD performance?
Are certain regions struggling due to economic, operational, or competition factors?
How does profitability vary across different markets?

- ðŸ”Ž Product & Category Insights
Which product types (Indoor, Outdoor, Landscape) drive the most revenue?
Do certain products generate higher profit margins despite lower sales?
Are there seasonal trends affecting specific product categories?

- ðŸ”Ž Profitability & Strategic Decisions
Which accounts generate high revenue but low margins (GP%)?
Should we prioritize profitable customers over high-volume sales?
Are pricing adjustments needed to improve GP% for key accounts?

## Business Impact & Recommendations
- âœ… Improve Market Penetration: Address underperforming countries (China, Sweden, France, etc.).
- âœ… Maximize High-Profit Products: Shift focus from low-margin, high-sales products.
- âœ… Capitalize on Peak Months: Strengthen marketing & sales efforts in high-performing months (March, October, Q4).
- âœ… Enhance Profitability Strategy: Prioritize high-GP% customers while optimizing revenue growth.
